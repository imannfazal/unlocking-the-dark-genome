# Unlocking the Dark Genome: Multimodal Transformers for Predicting Non-Coding Variant Functionality in Precision Medicine

### Overview
This conceptual paper proposes how **multimodal transformer models** can help decode the *non-coding regions* of the human genome by combining **genomic**, **epigenetic**, and **regulatory** data.  
It explores the idea that DNA, like language, has structure, syntax, and context â€” and can be interpreted through natural language processing (NLP) approaches.

### Core Idea
Integrate multiple data modalities to predict how non-coding variants affect gene regulation:
- Transformer-based sequence embeddings  
- Epigenetic and chromatin features  
- Cross-modal attention for variant effect prediction  

---

### Motivation
Most of the human genome is non-coding yet functionally vital.  
By adapting **language models** to biological data, we can build systems that interpret genomic information more intuitively and advance **precision medicine**.
